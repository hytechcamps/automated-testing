## Student Content
Student-facing content is available at [hytechcamps.github.io](https://hytechcamps.github.io/automated-testing).

## Icebreaker
Start things off with a quick icebreaker activity so the students can get to know each other: [This or That](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/This-or-That-An-Icebreaker-that-Rocks-1977647)

1. Use Zoom polls to ask a few "this or that" questions
    - e.g., tea v. coffee, winter v. summer, breakfast v. dinner
    - This can also be done by showing a slide with the questions
1. Once each student has stated their opinion, go around the Zoom room and have each student introduce themselves and explain their preferences

## Lecture
Present the [PowerPoint](AutomatedTestingForBeginners.pptx).

## Kahoot

## Follow-Along
Go through the [follow-along](FollowAlong.md) activity as a group. The instructor should share their screen, and the students should follow-along on their own computers. The instructor should ask the students for suggestions about what to do next.

## Challenge
Allow the students to complete the [challenge](Challenge.md). By the end, their code should look like the [hy_tech_answers.spec.js](CypressProject/cypress/integration/answers/hy_tech_answers.spec.js) file.
